## Summary of Project

- This project reads a CSV file from Lahman Databank on MLB data up to 2015. You are able to filter and sort based on a selected team and selected year range. You then can see a table with relevant data, when they won a World Series, home runs, hits, and win percentage over the years.
Summarize the skills your project demonstrates:Â This project shows my ability to grab data and build reactive tables. I created 2 reactive inputs (Team Select and Year Slider). I then created reactive outputs based on those variables. I updated the theme and all links as well. Overall, I think I was able to show reactive inputs and outputs, key data analysis insights, and creativity.
